## Instructors

### Contributors

## Study Group Description

To understand basic to moderate concepts related to React, Vue, and JS-based front-end frameworks.

## Learning Outcomes

You (the learner) have either gain the fundamental skills related to front-end development, specifically in React or Vue. Or, you have gained new knowledge to add to your existing font-end skills.

## End Result

For the duration of the study group, I will ask that each participant create their own React or Vue app in order to learn concepts on their own. This is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended you implement your own solution to further your learning.

## Prerequisites

Please have a basic grasp of html5, css, and js/ts. Specifically the ES6 and ES6 specifications. You will gain nothing from this study group if you do not have these fundamental skills.
